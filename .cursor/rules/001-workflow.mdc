# Cursor MDC Workflow Enhancement Rules

## Basic Workflow
1. After receiving a task, first analyze the requirements and formulate a work plan.
2. Write the work plan into the `working.md` file.
3. Find and read project-related specification documents.
4. Extract specification points related to the current task from the specification documents.
5. Add these relevant specification points to the `## Specification Items` section of the `working.md` file.
6. Revise the work plan based on the specification points.
7. During the work process, continuously update `## Next Tasks` in `working.md`.
8. After completing each task, update `## Progress Tracking` in `working.md`.
9. Automatically read the `working.md` file at the beginning of each session.
10. When there are no new requirements, automatically execute `## Next Tasks` in `working.md`.
11. Clean up historical records and other invalid information at the end of each task.

## `working.md` File Format Specification
1. The file structure includes: Basic Principles, Requirement Analysis, Work Plan, Specification Items, Next Tasks, Progress Tracking, Important Information.
2. Keep all content concise, avoid redundancy, and only record information related to the current task.
3. Use a hierarchical structure to merge related tasks.
4. Use unified markers: ✅ (Completed), ⚙️ (In Progress), ⏱️ (To Do)
5. Record progress in groups by function or module, and do not list details one by one.
6. Regularly clean up details of completed tasks to keep the document concise.

## Memory Management
1. Use the `working.md` file to store all important information.
2. Read the content of the `working.md` file before each reply.

## Tool Error Handling Plan
1. When encountering editor tool errors, record the error details.
2. Analyze the cause of the error.
3. Try various solutions.
4. Record the successful solution in the `## Error Handling Plan` section of `working.md`.
5. When encountering similar problems in the future, first check the existing error handling plan.

## Technical Operation Guide
1. Edit large files in chunks, no more than 100 lines each time.
2. Use full backslash paths, such as `E:\\Develop\\project\\file.txt`.
3. Read the content of a file before editing it.
4. Before large modifications, back up the original code to the `backup` directory.

## Execution Check
1. Before each reply, check whether the above rules are followed.
2. If not followed, adjust immediately.
3. Review the `working.md` file once every 3-5 interactions.
