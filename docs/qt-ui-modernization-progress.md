# Qt UI Modernization Progress

## Status

- Branch: `codex/qt-ui-modernization`
- Baseline commit: `4d3a1dca7` (`Restore shortcut preference semantics`)
- Last updated: 2026-08-16
- Current stage: Phase 4.4 in progress; responsive Material Browser columns, persistent
  scrollbar visibility, collapsible collection groups, Ctrl+wheel thumbnail sizing, and
  an inline size indicator complete

## Objective

Modernize TrenchBroom's desktop UI with a compact, consistent workbench design while
preserving the existing C++ editor core, Qt application lifecycle, input handling, and
OpenGL viewports.

The target is a TrenchBroom-specific design influenced by the information density and
visual hierarchy of VS Code. It is not a pixel-for-pixel VS Code clone and does not add
a runtime or source dependency on Code - OSS.

## Decisions So Far

1. Keep Qt Widgets for the first modernization effort.
2. Preserve `QOpenGLWidget` map and UV views instead of moving rendering to a web view.
3. Do not add Rust or Electron solely to improve appearance.
4. Use VS Code's public theme token taxonomy and default theme JSON files as design
   references only.
5. Establish TrenchBroom-owned theme tokens as the single source of truth for
   `QPalette`, `QProxyStyle`, QSS, and editor overlay colors.
6. Defer custom native title bars and general-purpose drag-and-drop docking until the
   lower-risk visual work has been evaluated.
7. Follow Code - OSS Modern UI's 4 px card gaps, 6 px compact-control radius, and 8 px
   workbench-surface radius without copying its DOM or adding a source dependency.
8. Use a narrow Inspector navigation rail with repository-owned icons, persistent page
   headings, tooltips, accessible names, and keyboard activation. This replaces the
   earlier horizontal segmented navigation after the supporting surfaces established a
   stable visual hierarchy.

## Repository Findings

- `app/TrenchBroom/resources/stylesheets/base.qss` is currently small and handles only
  a limited set of widget-specific adjustments.
- `app/TrenchBroom/src/Main.cpp` applies the dark theme through the Qt Fusion style, a
  custom `QPalette`, and a narrow `QProxyStyle` override.
- `MapWindow` uses horizontal and vertical splitters to arrange the map view, bottom
  information panel, and right inspector.
- The application already has reusable UI building blocks including `TabBar`,
  `TitleBar`, `Splitter`, `ContainerBar`, and `CommandPaletteDialog`.
- The main rendering and editing path is already separated from most widget styling,
  so a theme and workbench-shell pass can avoid changes to map geometry and rendering.
- The inspector and outliner contain substantial custom behavior and painting. They
  should be modernized after global metrics and state colors are stable.

## Proposed Theme Tokens

The initial token set should remain deliberately small:

- window, editor, sidebar, panel, input, and elevated backgrounds
- primary, secondary, disabled, and inverse text
- subtle, normal, strong, and focus borders
- hover, pressed, selected, inactive-selected, and disabled states
- accent, error, warning, success, and information colors
- compact control, toolbar, tab, tree-row, and status-bar heights
- narrow, normal, and wide spacing values
- small and normal icon sizes

Qt style sheets do not support reusable variables. Theme values should therefore live
in a typed C++ structure or a validated data file, with QSS placeholders expanded from
that source rather than duplicating literal colors throughout the application.

## Work Plan

### Phase 0: Discovery

Status: complete

- [x] Inspect the application and library boundaries.
- [x] Measure the current Qt UI and theme surface.
- [x] Identify the map-window layout and existing reusable UI controls.
- [x] Compare Qt modernization with Electron, Rust, and Code - OSS reuse.
- [x] Confirm that VS Code source is useful as a reference but unnecessary as a
      dependency.

### Phase 1: Theme Foundation

Status: complete

- [x] Add a TrenchBroom theme token model.
- [x] Generate `QPalette` and QSS values from the same token source.
- [x] Extend `QProxyStyle` for shared control metrics and focus behavior.
- [x] Standardize hover, pressed, checked, selected, disabled, and focus-visible states.
- [x] Standardize 16 px and 20 px icon metrics.
- [x] Add deterministic visual checks for light and dark themes at 100%, 150%, and
      200% scale factors.

Expected benefit: high. This should remove most of the platform-default Qt appearance
without changing window structure.

### Phase 2: Main Workbench Shell

Status: complete

- [x] Reduce toolbar height and visual noise.
- [x] Move persistent grid and editing state into compact status-bar segments where
      appropriate.
- [x] Restyle map-view tabs and contextual tool controls.
- [x] Give the editor, inspector, and bottom panel consistent card borders, gaps, and
      rounded corners.
- [x] Evaluate a narrow activity bar and retain labeled segmented inspector navigation
      for this phase.

Expected benefit: very high. This phase creates most of the recognizable compact
workbench layout while retaining the current splitter ownership model.

### Phase 3: Inspector And Outliner

Status: complete

- [x] Standardize tree row height, indentation, rounded selection, hover, and inactive
      states.
- [x] Reserve stable 28 px columns for visibility and lock while retaining node type
      and group indicators in the name hierarchy.
- [x] Add a consistent inset search, sort, and properties action row.
- [x] Align property names, values, and actions into a predictable responsive layout.
- [x] Introduce reusable collapsible section headers.
- [x] Verify multi-selection, Escape handling, and lock/visibility hit targets.
- [x] Verify keyboard row navigation and cross-layer drag-and-drop through the production
      transaction and tree-refresh path.
- [x] Preserve the existing explicit layer/group rename actions; inline tree editing is
      intentionally not introduced because it is not part of the current interaction model.
- [x] Evaluate warning indicators and defer them until the outliner has a stable warning
      data source.

Expected benefit: very high. Difficulty is medium to high because the outliner has
significant custom interaction and painting code.

### Phase 4: Supporting Surfaces

Status: complete

- [x] Restyle Console, Issues, Python panel tabs, and the Assets browser surface.
- [x] Expand the status bar with concise grid and snap state; defer selection, mode, and
      warning segments until they have stable application-state sources.
- [x] Restyle the existing command palette as a focused workbench overlay.
- [x] Apply the shared design system to preferences and high-traffic dialogs.

Expected benefit: medium. These changes complete consistency after the main editing
surface has established the visual language.

### Phase 4.1: Browser Content And Face Inspector Refinement

Status: complete

- [x] Draw shared rounded cell surfaces with palette-derived default, hover, and selected
      states in the OpenGL-backed Entity, Material, and Assets browsers.
- [x] Remove nested square Assets backgrounds and apply theme-aware sprite, sound, prefab,
      audio-control, and error presentation.
- [x] Separate Face tools, attributes, UV controls, and browser controls into stable styled
      sections without introducing nested cards.
- [x] Verify the affected supporting surfaces in Light and Dark themes at 100%, 150%, and
      200% scale factors.

Expected benefit: medium to high. The most visible custom-rendered content now follows the
same rounded component language as the surrounding Qt workbench instead of only sharing its
colors.

### Phase 4.2: Inspector Navigation Rail

Status: complete

- [x] Replace the visible horizontal Inspector tabs with a compact 44 px vertical icon
      rail while retaining `TabBook` page ownership and state persistence.
- [x] Add palette-driven hover, focus, checked, and accent-indicator states.
- [x] Keep page identity explicit through synchronized headings, tooltips, accessible
      names, and the existing keyboard shortcuts.
- [x] Verify Map, Entity, Face, Outliner, and Plugin navigation without changing editor,
      plugin, or document lifecycles.
- [x] Verify representative Inspector pages in Light and Dark themes at 100%, 150%, and
      200% scale factors.

Expected benefit: high. The Inspector now has a recognizable workbench navigation layer
without taking on the platform risk of a custom title bar or general docking system.

### Phase 4.3: Browser Controls And Empty States

Status: complete

- [x] Move Entity and Material browser controls above their content and split them into a
      full-width search row plus a stable sort/filter row for narrow Inspector widths.
- [x] Replace generic filter push buttons with compact rounded toggle controls and shared
      palette-driven hover, focus, pressed, and checked states.
- [x] Add centered theme-aware empty and no-match messages to OpenGL cell browsers while
      keeping filtering, selection, drag-and-drop, and resource loading behavior unchanged.
- [x] Add deterministic Entity and Material empty-result snapshot targets and verify normal
      and empty browser states in Light and Dark themes at 100%, 150%, and 200% scale.

Expected benefit: medium to high. Search and filter actions now read as a deliberate browser
toolbar, stay usable in the constrained Inspector, and provide clear feedback instead of a
blank content region when filters have no results.

### Phase 4.4: Material Browser Density And Selection Context

Status: in progress

The resource-backed acceptance capture shows that the current browser is functional, but its
content layout still reflects the legacy texture-at-native-aspect approach. Tall textures set
the row height while shorter textures leave uneven dark areas, short labels receive as much
space as long paths, and changing thumbnail size still requires leaving the browser for View
preferences.

- [ ] Put every material in a stable preview frame and aspect-fit the texture within it so
      mixed texture dimensions produce aligned rows without distorting the image.
- [x] Distribute residual browser width across complete material columns around the selected
      thumbnail size, and keep the scrollbar thumb visible before hover.
- [x] Replace passive collection labels with compact disclosure headers showing material counts,
      full-row pointer states, persistent collapse state, sticky expanded headers, and keyboard
      navigation/activation.
- [x] Support Ctrl+wheel thumbnail resizing through the existing persisted
      `MaterialBrowserIconSize` preference, with discrete size steps, high-resolution wheel
      accumulation, and unchanged ordinary scrolling.
- [ ] Elide long labels to one predictable line while retaining the full material name and
      dimensions in the existing tooltip.
- [x] Add an inline compact thumbnail-size control backed by the existing
      `MaterialBrowserIconSize` preference; reuse the established Assets browser control
      pattern instead of creating a second size setting.
- [ ] Add a quiet selected-material information row for the full name, dimensions, collection,
      and usage count, without introducing a permanent large preview pane.
- [ ] Extend deterministic acceptance with a dense mixed-aspect fixture state covering a
      selected material, used/default borders, long names, grouping, and scrolling.
- [ ] Validate click selection, face application, reveal, filtering, grouping, context actions,
      and the Replace Material dialog before closing the phase.

Expected benefit: high for repeated material-selection work. Difficulty is medium because the
OpenGL cell layout and hit testing must change together, but this remains much lower risk than
new docking or a separate full-size material browser window.

### Phase 5: Optional Structural Work

Status: deferred

- [ ] Evaluate a custom native title bar.
- [ ] Evaluate document tabs across maps.
- [ ] Evaluate general-purpose movable and dockable panels.

These items have high platform and interaction risk. They should proceed only if user
testing shows that the earlier phases do not meet the product goal.

## Initial Acceptance Criteria

- Existing map editing, input, focus, shortcuts, drag-and-drop, and OpenGL rendering
  behavior remains unchanged.
- Light and dark themes have complete active, inactive, disabled, hover, pressed,
  selected, and focus states.
- Text and icons remain readable at 100%, 150%, and 200% display scaling.
- The main editor dedicates more vertical space to map views than the current toolbar
  and contextual-control arrangement.
- Repeated controls use consistent heights, padding, border treatment, and icon size.
- The UI remains usable on Windows, macOS, and Linux without platform-specific layout
  breakage.

## Validation Strategy

- Build the focused `TbUiLibTest` target before running UI tests.
- Run relevant focused Catch2 filters for every changed component.
- Build the Release `TrenchBroom` target before completing a workbench phase.
- Run `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\ui-theme-acceptance.ps1` to
  capture the isolated welcome window, representative map workbench, and deterministic
  expanded Outliner/entity-properties, Entity Browser, Face Inspector, supporting
  Assets panel, Command Palette, Preferences pages for View, Colors, Mouse, Keyboard, and
  Misc/MCP,
  plus Entity/Material empty result states in light and dark themes at 100%, 150%, and
  200% scale. The 84-state matrix validates image dimensions, device-pixel ratio,
  nonblank pixels, font support, and file integrity, then writes PNG and JSON evidence plus
  a labeled visual-comparison contact sheet under
  `build-release-codex\codex-logs\ui-theme-acceptance`.
- Pass `-BaselineDir <approved-run-directory>` to turn the matrix into a visual regression
  gate. It compares downsampled pixels with configurable per-pixel and changed-area
  tolerances and fails when an expected baseline is missing or exceeded. Baselines must come
  from the same OS, Qt version, installed fonts, and renderer; a run without this option is a
  capture-integrity smoke test, not a visual regression test.
- Face Inspector and Material empty-result captures use the checked-in Quake 2 map/game
  fixtures rather than the generic empty map. Snapshot mode keeps external background services
  disabled but continues GL resource processing, waits up to five seconds for every fixture
  texture to reach GPU-ready state, and fails on missing, failed, or pending resources. Failures
  write a sibling `.error.txt` file which the acceptance script includes in its exception.
- Use `--ui-snapshot <path> --ui-snapshot-theme system|light|dark
  [--ui-snapshot-page map|outliner|entity-browser|entity-browser-empty|face-inspector|material-browser-empty|supporting|command-palette|preferences|preferences-colors|preferences-mouse|preferences-keyboard]
  [--ui-snapshot-game-path game-directory] [map-file]` for a focused
  single capture. Omitting the map captures Welcome unless a `preferences*` page is
  selected; supplying one captures the workbench. The Outliner
  page expands its hierarchy, properties panel, and active selection before rendering;
  the Entity Browser and Face Inspector pages widen the inspector for browser-color
  review; the Supporting page opens Assets and expands the bottom panel; the Command
  Palette uses a constrained 640 x 480 layout; the Preferences pages select View,
  Colors, Mouse, or Keyboard in the category sidebar. Snapshot mode uses temporary
  preferences, disables background services, and renders through the native Qt platform
  without showing the window. Material targets require loaded, GPU-ready textures before
  capture.
- Verify keyboard-only navigation, focus visibility, disabled states, and text fit.
- Keep generated screenshots and temporary visual reports out of commits unless they
  are intentionally selected as maintained references.

| 2026-08-16 | Verified | Passed `Theme`, `MapWindow`, and `TabBook` (175 assertions), built Release `TrenchBroom`, and visually confirmed 24 representative Inspector states at 100%, 150%, and 200% in `20260816-004245-712` and `20260816-004359-063`. |
| 2026-08-16 | Complete | Moved Entity and Material search/filter controls into compact top-mounted two-row toolbars with dedicated rounded toggle states. |

| 2026-08-16 | Complete | Hardened Material Browser snapshots with a real Quake 2 fixture, isolated game-path configuration, active GL resource processing, GPU-ready texture gates, bounded polling, and persisted failure diagnostics. |
| 2026-08-16 | Verified | Passed `Theme`, `MapWindow`, `ModelBrowserView`, and `UiSnapshot` (256 assertions), built Release `TrenchBroom`, visually checked and passed the complete 66-state Light/Dark matrix at 100%, 150%, and 200% in `20260816-015438-123`, and confirmed the invalid-game-path guard reports a deterministic resource timeout. |
| 2026-08-16 | Complete | Replaced the full-width accent status bar with a neutral theme surface and top divider, reserving blue for the compact active Snap state and interactive focus feedback. |
| 2026-08-16 | Verified | Passed `Theme` and `MapWindow` (208 assertions), built Release `TrenchBroom`, and visually checked 12 Workbench/Face Inspector Light/Dark states at 100%, 150%, and 200% in `20260816-021724-731`. |
| 2026-08-16 | Complete | Made Entity Browser columns responsive around the existing preferred tile size, distributing residual width across complete rows while retaining a practical minimum tile width. |
| 2026-08-16 | Verified | Passed `Theme` and `MapWindow` (208 assertions), built Release `TrenchBroom`, and visually checked normal and empty Entity Browser states in Light/Dark at 100%, 150%, and 200% in `20260816-022503-965`. |
| 2026-08-16 | Complete | Aligned global combo boxes and checkboxes with Code - OSS compact controls using theme-selected chevrons, 4 px select corners, reserved arrow space, rounded popup rows, and vector-drawn 18 px checked/mixed indicators with complete interaction states. |

| 2026-08-16 | Complete | Reduced `Main.cpp` to an application composition root by extracting proxy-style, palette, and QSS installation into `ApplicationStyle`, and snapshot target construction, resource readiness, capture scheduling, and dialog lifetime management into `UiSnapshotRunner`. Added repository guidance that keeps specialized UI and test-mode implementation out of the entry point. |
| 2026-08-16 | Verified | Passed `Theme,UiSnapshot,PreferenceDialog,MapWindow` (256 assertions), rebuilt Release `TrenchBroom`, visually checked the complete 66-state Light/Dark snapshot matrix at 100%, 150%, and 200% in `20260816-102151-481`, and rechecked the corrected explicit Outliner target in `20260816-102935-344`. |
| 2026-08-16 | Fixed | Centered the custom 18 px checkbox indicator with floating-point `QRectF` geometry so even-sized indicator rectangles no longer place the left and top half-pixel of their border outside Qt's paint clip. Added the Mouse preferences snapshot target to the default acceptance matrix, expanding it from 66 to 72 states. |
| 2026-08-16 | Verified | Passed `Theme,UiSnapshot,PreferenceDialog,MapWindow` (256 assertions), rebuilt Release `TrenchBroom`, visually checked the focused Mouse preferences matrix in `20260816-105354-479`, and passed the complete 72-state Light/Dark matrix at 100%, 150%, and 200% in `20260816-104915-316`. |
| 2026-08-16 | Fixed | Removed the blank leading column from the Keyboard and Colors preference tables by explicitly hiding their unused vertical headers. Added the Keyboard preferences target to the default acceptance matrix, expanding it from 72 to 78 states. |
| 2026-08-16 | Verified | Passed `PreferenceDialog` (27 assertions) and `PreferenceDialog.preferencePanes` (26 assertions), rebuilt Release `TrenchBroom`, and visually checked Keyboard and Colors in Light/Dark at 100%, 150%, and 200% in `20260816-110526-478` and `20260816-110546-071`. |
| 2026-08-16 | Complete | Aligned global integer and floating-point spin boxes with the compact control language: stable 19 px stepper columns, 4 px outer corners, subtle dividers, flat hover/pressed feedback, and theme-specific chevrons with distinct disabled states. |
| 2026-08-16 | Verified | Passed `Theme,MapWindow` (211 assertions), rebuilt Release `TrenchBroom`, and visually checked enabled and disabled spin boxes in the Face Inspector Light/Dark snapshots at 100%, 150%, and 200% in `20260816-113138-605`. |
| 2026-08-16 | Complete | Made Material Browser columns responsive around the selected thumbnail size so complete rows consume the viewport without a residual right strip. Increased resting scrollbar contrast while retaining distinct hover and pressed feedback. |
| 2026-08-16 | Complete | Hardened the Face Inspector snapshot to use 3x material thumbnails, directly covering the constrained two-column layout and persistent scrollbar instead of relying on the default small-tile state. |
| 2026-08-16 | Verified | Passed `Theme,MapWindow` (211 assertions), rebuilt Release `TrenchBroom`, and visually checked the responsive two-column grid and resting scrollbar in Light/Dark at 100%, 150%, and 200% in `20260816-121008-032`. |
| 2026-08-16 | Complete | Turned Material Browser collection labels into 24 px disclosure headers with chevrons, right-aligned material counts, full-row hover/pressed/focus feedback, compact collapsed geometry, persistent collapse state, keyboard operation, and automatic expansion when revealing a material. |
| 2026-08-16 | Verified | Passed `CellLayout` (13 assertions) and `CellView,Theme,MapWindow,ModelBrowserView` (251 assertions), rebuilt Release `TrenchBroom`, and visually checked grouped 3x thumbnails plus visible disclosure indicators in Light/Dark at 100%, 150%, and 200% in `20260816-124357-565`. |
| 2026-08-16 | Fixed | Increased unchecked checkbox edge contrast without changing global control borders: enabled borders now blend against each interaction-state background, hover and pressed states receive stronger emphasis, disabled borders remain distinguishable, and focus retains the theme accent. |
| 2026-08-16 | Verified | Passed Release `TbUiLibTest "Theme"` (31 assertions), rebuilt Release `TrenchBroom`, and visually compared the focused Mouse preferences Light/Dark snapshots at 100% in `20260816-133344-413` against the previous acceptance capture. |
| 2026-08-16 | Complete | Added Ctrl+wheel Material Browser thumbnail resizing across the 100%-500% preference steps, including high-resolution wheel accumulation, bounds handling, persisted preference updates, and unchanged unmodified scrolling. |
| 2026-08-16 | Verified | Passed the new Release `MaterialBrowserView` interaction test (7 assertions), passed `CellView,Theme,MapWindow,ModelBrowserView` (251 assertions), and rebuilt Release `TrenchBroom`. |
| 2026-08-16 | Complete | Added a compact Material Browser percentage indicator and selector to the filter row. It shares the 100%-500% preference steps, stays synchronized with Ctrl+wheel and View preferences, and keeps sort/filter controls stable at constrained Inspector widths. |
| 2026-08-16 | Verified | Passed Release `MaterialBrowserView,MapWindow` (194 assertions), rebuilt Release `TrenchBroom`, and visually checked the inline percentage indicator without clipping or toolbar overlap in Face Inspector Light/Dark snapshots at 100%, 150%, and 200% in `20260816-140448-183`. |
| 2026-08-16 | Complete | Changed the shared Material Browser thumbnail range to nine 50% steps from 100% through 500%, including the inline selector, View preferences, Ctrl+wheel bounds, legacy below-range clamping, and the maximum-size acceptance state. |
| 2026-08-16 | Verified | Passed Release `MaterialBrowserView,PreferenceDialog,MapWindow` (223 assertions), rebuilt Release `TrenchBroom`, and visually checked the `500%` Face Inspector state plus View preferences in Light/Dark at 100%, 150%, and 200% in `20260816-141642-333`. |
| 2026-08-16 | Fixed | Removed duplicate browser resize/reload work, made legacy MCP token cleanup non-blocking, consolidated Outliner row background painting in its delegate, and added asynchronous snapshot log capture plus optional pixel-tolerant baseline comparison. |
| 2026-08-16 | Verified | Passed Release `CellView`, `MaterialBrowserView`, `OutlinerTreeWidget`, and `McpBridgeConfig` (158 assertions), rebuilt Release `TrenchBroom`, confirmed identical Welcome captures report zero changed pixels, rejected a deliberately wrong baseline at 91.477%, and kept the selected Outliner row within the approved 0.2% visual tolerance. |
| 2026-08-16 | Complete | Replaced the standalone MCP preference page with a compact `McpSettingsWidget` embedded in Misc, reduced navigation to seven pages, removed compatibility pipe/config fields, and replaced the clipped command field with dedicated URL and Claude Code copy actions. Added an isolated config-path seam so preference reset tests never rewrite the user's MCP config. |
| 2026-08-16 | Verified | Passed Release `MiscPreferencePane`, `PreferenceDialog`, and `PreferenceDialog.preferencePanes` (100 assertions) plus `McpBridgeConfig` (53 assertions), rebuilt Release `TrenchBroom`, and passed zero-difference Light/Dark baseline comparisons for the new `preferences-misc` snapshot target in `20260816-170134-884`. |
| 2026-08-16 | Fixed | Prevented `Qt::Popup` panels from closing and immediately reopening when their trigger button is clicked a second time. `PopupWindow` now consumes the trigger-button mouse press before Qt can replay it, while preserving normal outside-click dismissal and subsequent reopening. |
| 2026-08-16 | Verified | Added the focused `PopupButton` regression test (5 assertions), passed `ViewEditor` (10 assertions), and rebuilt Release `TrenchBroom`. |
| 2026-08-16 | Fixed | Routed the expanded Misc/MCP preferences through the shared scrollable preference content so a dialog resized on another page cannot compress and overlap the MCP form rows. |
| 2026-08-16 | Verified | Added a compact-height Misc regression covering scrollbar activation and MCP row separation, passed `MiscPreferencePane` (42 assertions), `PreferenceDialog` (25 assertions), and `PreferenceDialog.preferencePanes` (46 assertions), rebuilt Release `TrenchBroom`, and passed the `920x560` Light/Dark snapshot matrix at 100%, 150%, and 200% in `20260816-192300-167`. |
| 2026-08-16 | Complete | Extended the `SETTINGS` region-anchor language through a shared semantic style used by Preferences and Inspector, and strengthened the existing bottom-panel tabs as uppercase `CONSOLE`, `PYTHON CONSOLE`, `ISSUES`, and `ASSETS` anchors without adding a duplicate title row. |
| 2026-08-16 | Verified | Passed Release `PreferenceDialog,MapWindow` (220 assertions) and `Theme` (31 assertions), rebuilt `TrenchBroom`, and visually checked Supporting, Preferences, and Outliner in Light/Dark at 100%, 150%, and 200% in `20260816-193347-889`. |
| 2026-08-16 | Next | Continue Phase 4.4 with stable mixed-aspect preview frames and predictable single-line labels before considering any deferred Phase 5 structural experiment. |
