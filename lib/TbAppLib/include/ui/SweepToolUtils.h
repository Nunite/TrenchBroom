 * its angle by `t` so that intermediate stations rotate proportionally. In arc mode, the
 * source is revolved about a pivot derived from `source` and `transform`, with the
 * translation along the rotation axis applied as a helical lift; if no usable pivot
 * exists, this falls through to the straight-path behavior. In straight/S-bend mode, the
 * source is scaled and rotated about its center and then translated, following an S-curve
 * offset when `parameters.pathMode` is `SweepPathMode::SBend` and `source.normal` is
 * non-zero.
 *
 * The result does not include the transforms of preceding iterations; callers that sweep
 * multiple iterations compose this with the accumulated transform of prior iterations.

 * parent node captured on each `SweepFace` (falling back to the map's default insertion
 * parent if that node no longer exists). Station vertices are rounded to integer
 * coordinates when `parameters.alignment` is `SweepAlignment::Integer`, except at the
 * very first station of the first iteration, which is kept exact since it corresponds to
 * the original source face. Invalid or collapsed segments are reported in the returned
